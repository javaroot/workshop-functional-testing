# Workshop: Functional testing...
## with Selenium

This workshop pretends to show some features about the Selenium usage. This talk was presented in SG Next 2016; the technologies are Java based but it doesn't matters because we can use another kind of platform.

To start this workshop you should:

- Download and unzip this repo
- Go to the directory in your command line
- In your CLI type:
  - For _*nix_ `./gradlew build`
  - For _windows_ `gradlew.bat build`

And that's all, you now have all the dependencies for run this repo.

We recommend you use some text editor or IDE like IntelliJ Idea.
